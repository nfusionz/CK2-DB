# Usage

Run `load_data.py SAVE_FILE_NAME` to load the data from the specified save file. If no name is specified, `Leon1067_02_12.ck2` file is chosen by default.

The data is placed into SQLite3 database file named `ck2-db.db`. You can use `sqlite3 ck2-db.db` to open it and run SQL queries by hand.

The conversion should take around a minute.

# Test Data

You can download test data (example save files) from:
- https://homepages.rpi.edu/~xieo/ck2_data.tar.gz
- https://homepages.rpi.edu/~xieo/ck2_data.zip

Both archives contain the following files (you can ignore the rest as it's outdated compared to what's integrated into the repo):

- `Leon1067_02_12.ck2` - This is the standard dataset. Does not contain any bloodlines.

- `Bloodlines.ck2` - Alternative dataset that contains bloodlines. This would need to be passed to the `load_data.py` as a parameter (i.e. `python3 load_data.py Bloodlines.ck2`)

# Example Queries

```sql
-- Query for getting all of the traits of noble people
SELECT birthname, dynastyname, traitname 
FROM person NATURAL JOIN dynasty NATURAL JOIN trait NATURAL JOIN traitlookup;
```

```sql
-- Query for getting noble people and their titles.
SELECT birthname, dynastyname, name as title, level
FROM (
  	SELECT personid AS holderid, birthname, dynastyname 
 		FROM person NATURAL JOIN dynasty) ppl 
NATURAL JOIN title;
```
Bear in mind that natural join of `person` and `dynasty` tables will try to match not only dynastyID, but also cultureID and religionID, often resulting in less results than you'd expect.

```sql
-- Query for the culture and religion for all living, noble people
SELECT birthname, dynastyname, culturename, religionname
FROM person NATURAL JOIN dynasty NATURAL JOIN culture NATURAL JOIN religion
WHERE deathday is NULL;
```
